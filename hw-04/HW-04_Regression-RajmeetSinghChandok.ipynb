    "<font size=+3>&#9998;</font> I think a good answer for this would be asking the question why are constants import in the first place. If we consider the equation $y=mx+b$. If we set x = 0 we can predict that the value is going to be B. But if we make the constant term b = 0, then we get $y = mx$. This would be mean that y =0 whhich means that we are assuming that the line is going to pass through the center which is not always true. Moreover because the model now just depends on x values primarly, it will predict values that are very high or very low. The constant hence forms a baseline for doing such prediction and removes any unecessary bias when predicting the data."
